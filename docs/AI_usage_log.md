# AI Usage Log - Team 5
**Project:** MoMo SMS Data Processing System

## Transparency Statement
We utilized AI tools (GitHub Copilot and Gemini) as collaborative assistants for technical syntax and documentation formatting. All core architectural decisions, entity relationships, and business logic are the original work of the team members.

## Interaction History
| Date | Tool | Task Description | Specific Prompts / Assistance | Human Oversight & Changes |

| Jan 24 | GitHub Copilot | SQL Syntax Check | Verified `CHECK` constraint syntax for the `Transaction_Status` column. | Manually added 5 custom transaction statuses based on MoMo requirements. |
